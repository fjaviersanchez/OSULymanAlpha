# README

This is a repository with a `jupyter notebook` exemplifying how to read a series of `brick` files.
In particular, the intent is that this notebook serves as a first step to read the `brick` files containing
Lya pass-1 QSO spectra. These `brick` files contain 2000 spectra in which some fraction are real QSOs and
some are stars.
